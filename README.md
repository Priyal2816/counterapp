# Counter App

---

##  Overview

The **Counter App** is a minimalist React application that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numeric counter. It’s an excellent demonstration of React fundamentals—state management, event handling, and UI reactivity.

##  Key Features (Planned/Current)

- **Increment & Decrement** — Change the counter value with button taps.
- **Reset Option** — Return the count to its initial value.
- **Responsive UI** — Easy to scale with additional controls or styling.
